_Author's note: This is a very work-in-progress guide, more of a scratchpad than finished page/guide/product/"thing". Please keep that in mind as you read!_

A few weeks ago, I tweeted this thread:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How long do your tests take to run?<br><br>Some tests suites take 5 minutes. Others take 45 minutes. <br><br>I&#39;ve done work around speeding up tests, and want to test my skills against real-world applications. <br><br>Will you pay me at least $100 to audit your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RoR</a> test suite? <br><br>üßµüëá</p>&mdash; Josh Thompson (@josh_works) <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_works/status/1392951464574787600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I offered to do this for $100. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, quickly upgraded it to $1000 after a few tweets suggested $1000 was the minimum possible amount for this service:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Strongly recommend you charge at least $1,000 to signal you&#39;re serious and know what you&#39;re doing. <br><br>&quot;I gave access to our source code to an extremely cheap contractor&quot; is not something most folks want to say to their boss.</p>&mdash; Ben Orenstein (@r00k) <a href="https://twitter.com/r00k/status/1393124330461143042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Since then, I've had three customers! It's been an absolute blast, and I've learned a ton. (For example, getting an entire app running locally, from `git clone` to `rails test` and having all passing tests _never_ takes just a few minutes)

This document will be a living guide for how I accomplished the audit (and how I'll conduct future audits) and what steps I've taken to do two things:

1. Profile the test suite (and what this actually means/why it's important, if it seems odd to spend time on this topic.)
2. Reduce the test run time (or related times, like file load time, CircleCI "time", etc)

For one customer, I took a 5 min test suite to 1:10, a 75% reduction in speed, thanks to VCR. I'll show you exactly how I did this.

For another customer, I got a ~20min test suite to ~11min, but it failed when getting pushed to CircleCI, and then the underlying issue (some _really_ slow DB queries) got fixed, so I'm auditing the app a second time, expecting to find a different set of issues.

For the third customer, the app is huge, complicated, and the tests take so long they don't run the whole suite on a regular laptop - it's delegated to CircleCI, and test runs eat up a lot of credits and time. 

I'm going to offer all of my lessons learned as this finished guide soon. Preorder the guide for $49, or an upgrade package that will come with at least a 1-hour call, where we talk about your questions, we can screenshare through your codebase, etc. Any purchaser gets added to my slack group, and you can ping me with questions at any time.

I'm offering this on pre-order, because I've not finished the guide yet! Once the guide is done )especially when I do this again and get a bit more experienced/sophisticated), I'll raise the rates quite a bit. I don't know when that'll be - could be months from now.

Early adapters will obviously work more closely with me, and vice versa - as I/my written instructions create additional value, I'll (probably) raise my rates.

# The Guide

I'm keeping _some_ running notes in this document. I'll eventually expand it into a coherent, elegant document, titled `The Complete Guide to Making Your Rails Tests Run Faster`, but like anything I make, it goes through many rounds of iteration and testing, and I need a "dump my thoughts" spot somewhere close to hand and easily accessible. 

Before I go farther, please know that I, _of course_ stand on shoulders of giants.

I'm fortunate to have crossed paths with Nate Berkapec's [The Complete Guide to Rails Performance](https://www.railsspeed.com/) and Jason's [The Complete Guide to Rails Testing](https://www.codewithjason.com/complete-guide-to-rails-testing/). 

Both of those guides are extensive, and incredible collections of learning and knowledge. In ways I'm trying to apply lessons from both of them to this problem, and nearly any thought I have in this domain _that is correct_ comes directly from Nate or Jason. (If you've not bought their books/courses for yourself _or especially your development team_ I'd encourage you to do so! You and your team will be thrilled!)

## Benchmarking & Profiling

Step 1 is always "benchmark and profile". 

Ideally, I use a command like:

```
$ time bundle exec rails test --profile 40 
$ time bundle exec rspec --profile 40
```

The `time` command is easy - look it up on your machine, or use [TLDR](https://github.com/josh-works/til/blob/main/cli/tldr-what-is-it-install-it.md). It `times` whatever comes next. 

`bundle exec` (I have aliased to `b` ) runs the exact gems/versions specified in the `Gemfile.lock`

`rails test`/`rspec` run the test suite

`--profile 40` `rspec` has this auto-included in it. It prints out diagnostic information about the slowest `n` tests, defaults to 10, I usually look at the slowest 40. There's a minitest gem for enabling profiling in minitest. 

## Get the app running locally

Oh man, this was a doozy. I ran into many issues. Many were tiny, required just a few googles to get through. 

We're used to something like:

```
$ git clone whatever
$ cd whatever
$ bundle install
$ bin/rails rspec
```

It's often quite a bit more. I actually wanna build a service that times how long from `git clone` to tests being done running _and passing_, or the app running locally and DB properly seeded, or both. 

For example:

- xcode-select commandline tools. Reinstalling fixes many things.
- Elasticsearch can be a PITA to get running w/Homebrew
- MySQL can be a doozy to get various flavors of databases 
- services are not trivial. (mongdb, mysql/mysqld, elasticsearch, running them in a container, or locally, or via homebrew, or all of the above, credentials/ports so all services can connect appropriately.)


There are lots of services that developers can install on their machines.

More notes to come

## After you've run some profiling/benchmarks

I'm free-associating through this. Each time I've done this, my "eye" is drawn in different directions to explore, so I'm hesitant to suggest hard-and-fast rules.

1. Tons of deprecation warnings, and a slow file load time? Maybe look into that.
1. Clean/easy test run, fast file load time? Look for common threads among the slowest tests.


Here's the specific items I'm auditing:

1. Best-case test run time
2. File load time
3. No-wifi run time/results
4. Flaky test count (if any)

Lets say you're investigating a slow file load time, especially if it's a low file load time for _every_ test:

```
Finished in 1.77 seconds (files took 1 minute 4.97 seconds to load)
```

That's the output of running a sample little test I built. I just created an empty file, and write a minimum-viable-spec for `String#capitolize`:

```ruby
# spec/models/string_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

describe String do
  it "should be capitalizeable" do
    string = "josh"
    expect(string.capitalize).to eq("Josh")
  end
end
```

When I run:

```
$ time bin/rspec spec/models/string_spec.rb

String
  should be capitalizeable

Finished in 1.77 seconds (files took 1 minute 40.54 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures

bin/rspec spec/models/string_spec.rb  0.25s user 0.14s system 0% cpu 1:44.37 total
```

There's a few reasons this high file load time causes problems, some obvious, some subtle. All there is to say is it's worth fixing. It's a big, complicated application, so I'm just capturing my thoughts...

Next, lets use a very sophisticated benchmarking tool to explore this ~2min file load time:

`puts` statements!

See, first, I commented out pretty much everything in `rails_helper`, to try to get the file load time down.

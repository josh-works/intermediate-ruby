I'm reading [Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/) by [Nadia Eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/), and wanted to capture something she said, talking about open source contributions:

> Sindre Sorhus, who maintains hundreds of JavaScript projects, once tweeted, "After having reviewed 10k+ pull requests on GitHub... ~80% of contributors doesn't [sic] know how to resolve a merge conflict." A few years later, he followed up with more observations:
> 
> - Almost no one writes a good pull request title More than half don't know about the `Fixes #112` syntax
> - ~30% don't run tests locally before submitting a PR
> - ~40% don't include docs/tests
> 
>> I've also noticed that the general PR quality has gone considerably down in the past few years. I guess it's a result of GitHub's increased popularity. ¯\\\_(ツ)_\/¯ 
> 
> It's not the fault of new developers. They don't know how open source works, and they've been told that they're doing the right thing by asking questions. "Don't let this be a deterrent for you to contribute though." Sorhus himself added. "Just keep in mind that my time is finite and if I have to go back and forth on your PR for stuff you could have caught yourself with a second look, you take time away from other PRs."

For example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some observations from having merged thousands of pull requests in the past few years:<br>- Almost no one writes a good pull request title<br>- More than half don&#39;t know about the `Fixes #112` syntax<br>- ~30% don&#39;t run tests locally before submitting a PR<br>- ~40% don&#39;t include docs/tests</p>&mdash; Sindre Sorhus (@sindresorhus) <a href="https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/1130791267393163267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

If you work through this OSS contribution series, you'll be guaranteed to be _effortlessly_ better than 30-40% of OSS contributors, by Sindre's math. 

And if you absorb a smidge more than this bare minimum, you'll be well on your way to being a highly-skilled OSS contributor.

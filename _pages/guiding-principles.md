My approach at Intermediate Ruby is informed by a few different resources:

## Chelsae Troy's `Anti-Racism Pedagogy`

[Anti-Racist Pedagogy in a Graduate Computer Science Class](https://chelseatroy.com/2020/06/24/anti-racist-pedagogy-in-a-graduate-computer-science-class/)

## Cedric Chin's `Tacit Knowledge` Series

[Tacit Knowledge Series](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/)

## Patric Collison's question on `two-sigma` phenomena

> **Is Bloom's "Two Sigma" phenomenon real? If so, what do we do about it?**
>
>Educational psychologist [Benjamin Bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bloom) [found (PDF)](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf) that one-on-one tutoring using [mastery learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning) led to a _two sigma_(!) improvement in student performance. The results were replicated. He asks in his paper that identified the "2 Sigma Problem": how do we achieve these results in conditions more practical (i.e., more scalable) than one-to-one tutoring?
>
> In a related vein, this [large-scale meta-analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654317751919) shows large (>0.5 [Cohen's d](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_d)) effects from direct instruction using mastery learning. "Yet, despite the very large body of research supporting its effectiveness, DI has not been widely embraced or implemented."

## Hundreds of hours teaching/pairing with Turing Students

I've built a detailed multi-part guide: [Intro to Turing's backend program](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-01-intro), as well as updating/writing-from-scratch most of the READMEs on Turing's [ruby-exersises](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises) repository.

I've made dozens (probably hundreds) of incremental improvements to both of these resources based on what I've directly observed or been told by students. 

My most recent video walk-through is visible at the top of [the repo README](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises/blob/main/README.md) and encapsulates much of how I'll be building resources going forward. 

## Drills and Exercises

As Patric Collison mentioned, `mastery learning` leads to massive improvements in student outcomes. 

Turing's [ruby-exercises](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises) are the gold standard for students learning Ruby. Maybe someday I (or someone else) will build an equivalent set of JavaScript exercises for Turing's front-end program.

I've been working on [Intermediate Ruby Obstacle Courses](https://github.com/josh-works/intermediate_ruby_obstacle_course) which will pair well with the resources and guides I'm making here.

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Josh! 

Pretty much every experienced developer I spoke with, I have asked some variation of:

> How did grow to become a better software developer? What do you recommend to others as they pursue improving their skills?

I got answers like:

- "Read lots of source code"
- "Work on side projects"
- "Make open source contributions"

This never has sat right with me, though, for a few reasons:

- Selects against women.
- Pace is slow
- relevance is low
- I still had to "fill in the gaps" to make the new knowledge actionable
- Difficult to port the learning (from a book or video) over to my own environment.

### Obstacle Courses

One project I've made so far is a [obstacle course for parsing webpages with Nokogiri](https://github.com/josh-works/intermediate_ruby_obstacle_course/tree/master/nokogiri). I spent about thirty hours learning Nokogiri, and the way it's packaged, you can learn most of what I learned, in about _4 hours_.

### Quotes

from the VP Engineering standpoint:

> if I can get anyone to take a course, and they learn even one thing, the ROI on that is insane. not even measurable how high it is.

> If I can get an engineer to focus on their craft, the job is done

> If they have not used sidekik before, there's some fear, because that's what I know

> to get an engineer to spend a few minutes on some new technology, the attitude of making things better.

> It's hard to get people to care.

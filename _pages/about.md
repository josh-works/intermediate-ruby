ðŸ‘‹ I'm Josh! 

I write a lot on the internet, some of it is here, some of it is elsewhere.

I'm a software developer by trade, more or less. 

I don't just press buttons on my keyboard. 

I've been on [a podcast](https://www.greaterthancode.com/safety-science-and-failure-as-an-opportunity) and given some talks, like [this talk for Boulder Ruby Group](https://josh.works/boulder_ruby_group). 

I've even once gave given public testimony to the board of a fairly influential organization! I'll tell you about it via email!

When I'm at my best, I create value.

Do you need something to do your job better?

Is it at least slightly related to Ruby, Rails, and/or software development?

Perhaps you would loveâ€¦

- A how-to guide
- A walk-through of some piece of technology
- A bug fix or feature added to an open-source tool

I'm open to talking about it!

If you're representing just yourself, or your company, I'd love to talk with you more about it!

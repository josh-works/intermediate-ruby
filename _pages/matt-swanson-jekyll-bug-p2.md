_This is the second part of a short series on pairing with a super-experienced software developer to fix an open-source issue in Jekyll._

_In Part 1, Matt explained how he identified [this particular issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7973) for us to work on._

_This series (and more series in the future) will constantly attempt to surface the [tacit knowledge](https://commoncog.com/blog/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/) that experienced developers use to do their work._

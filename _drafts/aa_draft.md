## How Done Is This Post?

_Anything I write ranges from "super rough notes-as-i-go, don't even expect full sentences" to "this post is done and proven to deliver what it promises to deliver"_

1. Scratch-pad, take-notes-as-I-go **<-- we are here**
1. Review post, clean up for first 'share'
1. I `mkdir` new directory, follow my own guide as if it were my first time encountering the material, iron out gaps/holes
1. Integrate feedback/answer questions from others
1. Final cleanup, post is considered `done` unless someone reaches out with further questions

#### Footnotes

[^fn1]: demo this is a footnote. It's long, contains a few sentences, but even long footnotes sometimes need a second paragraph as part of it.
    So this is a multi-paragraph footnote.
    It's possible  (maybe?) to even include code:
    ```
    { this: that }
    ```

    It can include all sorts of formatting!

    And images!

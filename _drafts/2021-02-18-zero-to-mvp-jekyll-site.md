I was chatting with a turing Alumni recently, about blogging and setting up a personal website. 

I've told _so many Turing students_ that they should blog, at least via Medium, but sometime shortly thereafter, they should move to a personal website.[^i-can-explain-why]

[^i-can-explain-why]: I could write list of reasons for why I think this. It's not the most important thing in the world, but I consider it a broadly defensible statement.

Someone just said:

> Also working on my website as well and having a tough time grasping Jekyll so thats next on my to-do list. I not sure how to get the page layout like your while using markdown :thinking_face: or did you use HTML and CSS?

And I wrote back with:

>I just bought a new domain recently - `afailuretodisagree.com`
I want to set it up as a bare jekyll site, via google domains, tied to github pages.
> I don't know what theme I'll use - something from https://jekyllthemes.io/.

So, let me hook up `afailuretodisagree` with a jekyll template. 

I made this statement about ten minutes ago, lets see how long it takes. [proof]

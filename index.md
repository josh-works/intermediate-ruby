## Learn Intermediate Ruby, make more ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

We all got into software development for different reasons. I suspect, though, that there are commonalities among us:

- We like to be well paid
- We like to solve problems at scale
- The work environment for the average development team is _way_ healthier than many work environments we've come from in the past, like construction, service, sales, academia. 

But once we get into software, and we land that first job, what next? 

Some of us get lucky and learn a lot on the job, from our team. 

Some of us are less lucky, and feel stuck in that job, not learning, even though we're working as hard as we can to complete what we're assigned!

I'm not interested in learning _just_ for the sake of learning. 

**I'm interested in learning because in the field of software, when I learn more, _I get more power_.**

This "power" can be converted to more pay, or more interesting projects, or promotions, more impact, different and better jobs, more time off, less hours, etc. 

If access to more power is interesting to you, you're in the right place, because in general, we can convert "power" to "other things we want", similar to how money can be converted to other desirable things.[^what-we-like]

Ironically, by being a _better software developer_ I can spend _less time_ writing code, and be better paid for it. 

That's what this project is all about.

[^what-we-like]: Within reason, of course. Even "senior" (high-power) developers deal with challenging management practices and constrained work environments. They can _relatively_ easily convert this power to improved work situations. A fresh grad of a software development intensive program, however, has less power and less access to desirable jobs.

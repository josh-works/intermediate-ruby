## Learn Intermediate Ruby, make more money

I got into software development for a few reasons:

- I like to solve problems at scale
- I like to be well paid
- I like to do many things besides software development, and _being a good software developer leaves lots of time in my life to do those other things_, like rock climbing, reading books, hanging out with my family, and much more.

The better I've gotten at the core piece of software development, the more items from this list I get to have. 

Ironically, by being a _better software developer_ I can spend _less time_ writing code, and be better paid for it. 

It took me a few years to learn what I know now. I want you to learn everything I know in half the time it took me to learn it.

That's what this project is all about.

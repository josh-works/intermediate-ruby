## Learn Intermediate Ruby, make more money

We all got into software development for different reasons. I suspect, though, that there are commonalities among us:

- We like to be well paid
- We like to solve problems at scale
- The work environment for the average development team is _way_ healthier than many work environments we've come from in the past. (Construction, service industries, sales, academia, etc.) (I, Josh, have never put my life in danger doing my job as a software developer. That wasn't the case when I did construction.)

But once we get into software, and we land that first job, what next? Some of us get lucky and learn a lot on the job, from our team. 

Some of us get unlucky, and feel stuck in that job, not learning.

I'm not interested in learning _just_ for the sake of learning. I'm interested in learning because in the field of software, when you learn more, _you get more power_. 

That power can be converted to more pay, or more interesting projects, or promotions, more impact, different and better jobs, more time off, less hours, etc. 

We get more of all the stuff in life that we as humans like to do, related to software development or unrelated so software development, as we get learn more.<sup>1</sup>

Ironically, by being a _better software developer_ I can spend _less time_ writing code, and be better paid for it. 

It took me a few years to learn what I know now. I want you to learn everything I know in half the time it took me to learn it.

That's what this project is all about.

**1** _Of course, there's a well-known problem in the industry that even "senior developers" who know everything and can do anything (from my point of view) still deal with crappy management practices and have highly constrained work environments... but they can snap their fingers and have a new job. Someone with six months of experience under their belt will have a harder time job hunting._

## Deliver more value faster

As a software developer, you deliver value to the company that pays you.

All else equal, it's better to deliver _a greater quantity_ of value _more quickly_. 

Greater quantity, faster. 

I'm going to help you with this.

What might this value delivery look like for you, a software developer?

- If a customer reports a critical bug, _you fix it_. 
- If your customers would be well-served by a critical feature, _you build it_. 
- If your sales team would be more effective with some custom tooling, _you build it_.
- If your marketing team wants more data to segment their communications, _you get them the data_. 
- If another division in your organization needs access to some of your data, _you build a secure way for them to access it_. 

What's the common theme running through these examples?

_Solving business problems, often with software_

I want you do deliver more value to:

- your team
- your product manager
- your customers
- your manager
- the business units you support
- _yourself_

> Hold up, Josh. Are you saying I can deliver more value _to myself_? You lost me there.

Yes. As a software developer, you get rewarded in proportion to the value you deliver. 

Who do you think gets paid and respected more? The person who: 

1. earns their company $250,000/yr?
2. earns the company $750,000/yr?
3. earns the company $2,000,000/yr?

When you deliver more value to your company, you reap benefits like:

- Higher pay
- More respect/appreciation from your peers
- Access to opportunities to work on high-value projects
- More flexibility around how much and when you work

Everyone wins.

## How we'll work together to help you become a better software developer

I hope you're convinced that good things come to those who deliver value. 

Understanding the above is the easy part. The hard part is figuring out what to do about it.

That's where I come in. 

## Some of the topics you'll learn:

Working together, you'll learn how to be an effective member of your team as you work on features/bugs related to:

- Background jobs with Redis & Sidekiq
- Active Cable & Websockets
- ActiveRecord
- Cron jobs
- Sending email from a Rails app
- Receiving and processing email in a rails app
- How to hook up a Rails app with a third-party ESP 
- Sending text messages
- logging
- Building JSON API endpoints
- Token authentication for endpoints
- Rubocop setup/configuration
- load testing your application with Siege
- How to interpret `rack-mini-profiler` output
- Setting up Application Performance Monitoring with DataDog or NewRelic
- Using Mixpanel in Rails for A/B testing
- Rake tasks to do all sorts of things
- Shell scripting
- Deplying an 'as good as native' Android/iOS app using Turbolinks, inspired by [RailsConf 2016 - Turbolinks 5: I Canâ€™t Believe Itâ€™s Not Native! by Sam Stephenson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWEts0rlezA)
- Stripe integration(s)
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) in Rails
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) in Rails
- Sorbet and Static Type Checking in Ruby


## How you'll actually learn this information

You might look through the above list and think

> This is a lot to learn. How can someone learn all this alongside their regular job? 
> 
> I cannot stop working to go into full-time study mode!

Quite right! It's _hard_ to move knowledge from one person's head to someone else's head. 

I've got a few tools in the toolkit here, to help you learn new information as fast as possible:

1. Detailed Guides
1. Video walk-throughs
1. Production Code & Examples
1. Hyper-focused Obstacle Courses (Drills focusing on: ActiveRecord, Nokogiri, Regexs, etc)

Depending on the topic at hand, a different mix of resources is the most appropriate.

Every resource I make, I test-drive with early-career software developers. 

We "pair" on what I've made, and based on what I observe and their feedback, I refine what I've made to it more quickly delivers value, in a more easily digestible way. 


## Who is this designed for?

These resources are laser-focused on a very specific group of people:

**Early-career software developers who work at least partially in Ruby/Rails**

These guides are not intended for experts who have deep familiarity with the specific technology. 

On the other hand, if you're a bit of a generalist software developer, hired to work on a Rails application, at various times you'll cross paths with many of the technologies I've listed above. 

It is to your advantage to quickly gain basic working knowledge and experience with the technology. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who are you?

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Josh! 

I'm a software developer.

## Quotes

> I love the README explainer! So much more thorough than the Nokogiri documentation, really great stuff.

>  I was able to go from 0 to `scraping the [Hacker News Comment thread]` with only this repo and the Nokogiri docs as resources.




### Who is this designed for?

I want to help out early-career Ruby/Rails developers. 

I'm building what I wish had existed when I first started working, so I'd spend less time fumbling with new technologies, and more time solving business problems. 

In 2017, when I started my first job, I worked primarily in Ruby/Rails (with some Elixir), and felt like I spent a lot of the first two years stumbling around in the dark. I'd finish one ticket, having just been exposed to some complicated concept in programming, and before that new information had time to consolidate in my brain, I was on to another ticket, wrestling with another giant piece of abstraction. 

### Who is this _not_ designed for?

If you consider yourself to be a senior developer, or maybe not even a senior developer, but you don't see much value in expanding your skillset, these resources might not be a good fit for you.

If you're quite aware of your relative inexperience, however, and find yourself regularly wondering if you've got the skills and knowledge you need to do your job, _you're in the right place_. 

### What if I want to stop halfway through?


Advice:
- If video w/open source people, start with structure of what I want to cover:
- Lesson 1, refactoring legacy code

Start with end thing, in bullet points
don't do anything else until I redo home page, "what does intermediate ruby mean: Title"

if I were your boss:
- No idea how or why any of this makes sense
- environment setup? 


### What if I want my money back

If you want your money back anytime between when you purchase and a year from when you purchase, just let me know and you'll get it all back.

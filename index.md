Hello,

Around here, you'll find thoughts related to "intermediate" software develpment, focused on the Ruby ecosystem. 

Therefore, if you are interested in topics related to "intermediate" Ruby, the writing of it, the people that that "write it", hiring people that can write it, etc, keep reading. 

Maybe you're a software developer. It's your day job, and you at least sometimes write (and get paid for "writing") Ruby and/or Rails.

Regardless of your experience level[^xp], if you find yourself sometimes saying something like:

[^xp]: You may self-identify as "junior", "intermediate", "advanced" or something else entirely. 

> I feel under-skilled in my self-assessed mastery of the Ruby programming language OR something closely related. I would like to learn to identify, write, function within an 'intermediate' level, using Ruby/Rails, especially in ways that would let me feel like a better overall software developer/problem identifier/solver.

Or:

> I feel like I am an "intermediate" software developer, but want to be a full-flegged, confident, externally-validated "advanced software developer" [^fn1]

Obviously, a reader might be in a vastly different spot of their programming career development. The favorite way any of us become 'intermediate' at something _quickly_ was thanks to the responsive training efforts from experts. At minimum, you'll likely be entertained.

No need to hear only _my_ words, though.

## Some things others have said about things I've made:

> I've read the first two parts of your [Open-source bug fixing with Matt Swanson](https://intermediateruby.com/make-oss-contributions-part-1-finding-an-issue) series so far, and I LOVE IT. **I love how you're using video to get an expert to verbalize what they're thinking**.

> This is so, so good.

> [many software developers] credit you with huge gains in learning/understanding because of [resources I, Josh made]. 
>
> Being able to have concise instruction that I can pause, or slow down, or rewind has really allowed me to learn some basics at my own pace, without the general nervous anxiety I can get, when I feel like I missed something.

## What to click next?

I've got a few different resources, and this entire curriculum[^ick] is under rapid development. The easiest way to follow along is with your email address:

[^ick]: 'Curriculum' isn't the best word, necesarily. There's several elements of traditional education I don't like, and I generally found lots of educational environments to be coercive, and I certainly don't truck with coercion in learning. I have receipts. Sometimes it makes sense to coopt language from legible, traditional educational environments, sometimes not.

I'll start introducing resources like my [Intermediate Ruby Obstacle Course](https://github.com/josh-works/intermediate_ruby_obstacle_course) and [Pairing on Open Source Software: Bugfixing with Matt Swanson](https://intermediateruby.com/make-oss-contributions-part-0-introduction)

Oh, and once you punch in your email address, I'll send you some questions. I promise it'll be worth your time, and it's effortless to unsubscribe.

## Footnotes

[^note-about-footnote]: These footnotes can be useful and/or self-indulgent. To use them, wherever there's a little blue number, tap or click it. The page will "jump" down to this section, and will try to scroll to the appropriate footnotes. Depending on how much space there is below the footnote, the page will or will not end up there. Click/tap this blue arrow at the end of this sentence to "jump" back to the matching footnote marker.


[^fn1]: Whatever "intermediate" and "advanced" _actually_ means. They're obviously being used in a short-hand, vastly-compressed way.
